## Description

This project focuses on the development and implementation of machine learning techniques to classify images of traffic signs into their respective categories. It explores the end-to-end machine learning workflow, including data exploration, preparation, and modeling, while incorporating both traditional algorithms and modern deep learning methods.

## Project Overview:
### Part 1: Data Exploration, Preprocessing, and Naïve Bayes Classification
In Part 1, we focused on exploring the dataset, preprocessing the data, performing feature selection, and applying the Naïve Bayes classifier. Below are the key findings:

#### Data Visualization and Exploration:

We visualized the class distribution using a pie chart and examined the pixel intensity distribution, revealing that most pixels range from 0 to 50, indicating darker regions.
##### Image Enhancement:
- Applied Histogram Equalization and Gamma Correction to improve image contrast and brightness, enhancing the greyscale images for better feature extraction.
Data Preprocessing:

- Normalized pixel values by dividing by 255 and handled missing values (none found). Outliers were identified using DBSCAN, which detected 3,680 outliers.
Feature Selection:

Used SelectKBest to retain the top 5, 10, and 20 features for each class, forming datasets with progressively fewer features for analysis.
Model Evaluation:

Evaluated three Naïve Bayes classifiers (Gaussian, Multinomial, and Complement) using K-Fold Cross Validation. The models performed best with the top 5 features, with the Multinomial Naïve Bayes achieving an accuracy of 60.8%.
Confusion Matrix and ROC Curve:

Generated confusion matrices and ROC curves for each model, showing that feature selection enhanced the model's performance, with the highest ROC AUC achieved using the top 5 features.

#### Part 2 - Unsupervised Learning:
* Utilized clustering techniques to identify inherent groupings within the dataset.
#### Part 3- Supervised Learning:
* Implemented and compared various machine learning algorithms, including:
1. Naïve Bayes
2. Linear Regression
3. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
4. Decision Trees
5. Addressed challenges such as overfitting and generalization using cross-validation and regularization.

#### Advanced Machine Learning Techniques:
* Designed and trained Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) for enhanced accuracy.
* Leveraged Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to process and classify image data efficiently.
